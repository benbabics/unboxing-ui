# Treo - Admin template and Starter project for Angular

# How to start the servers and app
Open terminal and install dependencies `npm i`
Open two tabs in terminal and run both servers:
Run `npm start:mocks` to start the json-server lib with restful mock data
Run `npm start` to start the angular app. FYI - you will need to have angular installed.

Login with: `bbabics@gmail.com` / `password`

Open up the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Local server to view anywhere
`lt --port 4200 --subdomain ui-unboxing`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
